===== Answer =====

Answer: Based on my information, there are no specific prerequisites mentioned for writing the master's thesis in Information Systems. However, it is mentioned that the thesis should be written in the research context of one of the method tracks IM, PM, BN, BI, and/or ISD, suggesting that students should have a good understanding of these tracks before embarking on their thesis.
Expected answer: 60 credit points
